            <p class="desc" id="expand1" style="max-height: 0rem;">Virtual Pets Shelter is an app where you take care of an entire shelter of pets. It takes the pets in the Virtual Pet project and creates multiple instances of them while giving the option to manage them all at once. Each pet's values decreases differently and the feature to add or adopt pets has been added. Coded in Java.</p>
            <p class="desc" id="expand2" style="max-height: 0rem;">Virtual Pets Amok takes what Virtual Pet Shelter did but instead categorizes pets between organic and robot, as well as cats and dogs. Organic pets need to be fed and watered while robotic one need to be oil periodically. Cats have a shared litterbox while dog each have a designated pen. Pets can be any combination of robotic/organic and cat/dog following the rules of either. Coded with Java.</p>
            <p class="desc" id="expand3" style="max-height: 0rem;">Review Site (Full stack) is a site where users can add and delete reviews.

            <p class="desc" id="expand4" style="max-height: 0rem;">WeCanCodeIt is an app made for teacher and librarians. Inspired by the Domino's book-it program, librarians are able to login to a created profile and create reading groups. They are then able to add books to each group using Google Books API and assign point values to each book. Discussion question and set goals can also be added to groups which are also assigned points. Reader users on the other end can then see and interact with these as well as send friend requests between users in the same group.

                <p>I have been coding since I was 16, gradually building up my skill set to now. The passion I have for both coding and learning have stayed strong through the years.  It is the sense of wonder from starting something new and the satisfaction from completing a challenging task that I enjoy the most. I have experience using Java, C, Basic, CSS, HTML, JSON, SQL, JQuery, Spring, Hibernate, AJAX, JPA, Rest APIs. I'm used to working in teams using SCRUM/Agile methodology. I love learning new things and seeing how they can apply to what I already know.</p>
